# Ethical Model Calibration
Code to accompany the project *Ethical Model Calibration - Diagnosing and Mitigating Hidden Bias in Healthcare Models*
## Objective
The objective of this project was to provide a framework to identify and mitigate bias in healthcare machine learning models, based on model performance in the latent space.
## Data
This project used two custom datasets from the UK Biobank.
## How to use
Add filepaths to `Main.py` and `Parameters.py`<br/>
Run the main experiment loop contained in `Main.py`<br/>
Run additional experiments contained in `Experiments_[NAME].py`<br/>
Parameters are contained in `Parameters.py`. Functions are contained in `Functions.py` and `Functions_BVAE.py`.
